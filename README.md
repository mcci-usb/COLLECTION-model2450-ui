  This TOC uses the VS Code markdown TOC extension AlanWalk.markdown-toc.
  We strongly recommend updating using VS Code, the markdown-toc extension and the
  bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles extension. Note that if you are using
  VS Code 1.29 and Markdown TOC 1.5.6, https://github.com/AlanWalk/markdown-toc/issues/65
  applies -- you must change your line-ending to some non-auto value in Settings>
  Text Editor>Files.  `\n` works for me.
